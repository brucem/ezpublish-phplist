PHPlist module
===========================
This module introduces a new datatype "PHPList Subscribe".  When this datatype
is added to a user class it allows for: 
+ user details to be added and synchronised with PHPlist 
+ subscription and unsubscription from a nominated list.
+ user is removed from PHPList when deleted from eZ publish

Requirements
-----------------
PHPlist 2.10.1 & above*
eZ publish 4.0x

* Note: The phpList tables must be in the same database as eZ publish and use
the default "phplist_" table prefix.

See the TODO document for other features that will be added.


Installation
-----------------
Follow these steps to add the PHPlist module to your eZ publish installation:

  1) Extract the archive into the /extension directory

  2) Edit site.ini.append in /settings/override. Add the following to the file:

       [ExtensionSettings]
       ActiveExtensions[]=phplist

     If you already have the [ExtensionSettings] block, just add the second line.

Usage
-----------------
Edit the user content class and add a "PHPList Subscribe" attribute.  You will
be presented with a list of active lists.  Choose one of these lists and store
the user content class.  Name the attribute something like "Subscribe to
mailing list"

Now when editing a user a checkbox will appear, allowing the user to be
subscribed to the nominated list.  Unchecking the box will unsubscribe the
user.  The users email address will be updated if it is changed.

Use of this feature implies that all user interaction
(subscribe/unsubscribe/preference editing) is handled via the eZ publish user
object.  To ensure this is the case you should configure PHPlist to use pages
on your eZ Publish site for these functions.  This can be done via the
'configure' option in PHPlist admin and editing the following options: 
+ URL where users can subscribe
+ URL where users can unsubscribe
+ URL where users have to confirm their subscription
+ URL where users can update their details

Attribute Mapping
-----------------
Currently to use this you need to edit settings/phplist.ini.php and maunally
add the mapping of the ezpublish attribute id to the phplist attribute id.

[AttributeMap]
MapEzPhplist[246]=1
MapEzPhplist[247]=2
MapEzPhplist[457]=3

Will map eZ Attribute ID 246 to phplist users attribute id 1 etc.

This will work for text fields and may work select or radio phplist attributes.

Importing eZ users into PHPList
-------------------------------
Once you have installed the extension and included the "PHPList Subscribe"
attribute to the user class you can run the script eztophplist.php.  This
script will process all content objects that include a PHPList Subscribe"
attribute and import them into PHPList.

The script can also be used to sync user details .
